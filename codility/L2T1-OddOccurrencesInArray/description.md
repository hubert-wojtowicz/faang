Assumption:
- N is an odd integer within the range [1..1,000,000]
- each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000]
- all but one of the values in A occur an even number of times

For case:
  A[0] = 9  A[1] = 3  A[2] = 9
  A[3] = 3  A[4] = 9  A[5] = 7
  A[6] = 9

Answer is:
