# This is dynamic programming problem. We need solve recursion:
# dp[n-1] = A[n-1] + max(dp[n-1-1],...dp[n-1-k]), where 1<=k<=6 and n-1-k >= 0
# dp[0] = A[0]

# First try top-bottom method as it is easy.
# Then if not satisfy requirement let use bottom-up method to save memory and do not use recursion.

# for N [2..100,000] and Ai in [âˆ’10,000..10,000] where 0 <= i < N
# max sum is 100,000*10,000 = 10^9 what can be handle by int
